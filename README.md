# dmcc: AVAYA library for Haskell

[![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/f-me/dmcc.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/f-me/dmcc)

This package contains a Haskell library which can be used to implement
computer telephony integration using AVAYA DMCC XML API. A simple
server (dmcc-ws) built atop the library is also included. The server
allows clients use JSON-over-WebSockets to control AVAYA agents,
receive event notifications and agent state updates.

The package uses third-party call control functions. There's no
first-party call control support and no access to media streams.

AVAYA DMCC XML API is largely based on ECMA-354 (CSTA Phase III)
standard, so in theory the package can be used with other compliant
telephony solutions.

## Site-specific notes

One basic TSAPI license is consumed for every agent controlled by
the library.

DMCC 6.x is supported. Consult your Avaya AES administration page to
check for software versions and available licenses.

## dmcc-ws server

The server exposes portions of Haskell library interface via
WebSockets using JSON messages for client-server exchange. Its purpose
is to provide a clean agent-centric interface to DMCC API suitable for
usage from client applications running in a browser.

The server is invoked as `dmcc-ws dmcc-ws.cfg`. See example
configuration file at `dmcc-ws/example.cfg`.

To start controlling an agent with extension XXX, connect to WebSocket
URL `http://host:port/XXX`. The server accepts client commands in
JSON:

    {"action":"MakeCall","number":989150603267}

Consult `DMCC.Action` documentation in Haddock docs for DMCC library
for supported commands.

The server reports telephony events along with updated agent snapshot:

    {
      "newSnapshot": {
        "state": ["Busy", ""],
        "calls": {
          "179": {
            "failed": false,
            "held": false,
            "ucid": "00001001791428242051",
            "interlocutors": [
              "989150603267:ADACs8300::0"
            ],
            "start": "2015-04-05T13:52:52.803Z",
            "direction": {
              "contents": [],
              "dir": "Out"
            },
            "answered": "2015-04-05T13:53:02.686Z"
          }
        }
      },
      "dmccEvent": {
        "callId": "179",
        "event": "EstablishedEvent"
      },
      "tag": "TelephonyEvent"
    }

Client applications may use events to update their interface or
process the whole state every time an event arrives.
